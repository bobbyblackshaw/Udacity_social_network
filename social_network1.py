# Intro to CS Final Project   #
# Gaming Social Network       #
# --------------------------- #
#

# Background
# ==========
# You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming
# social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know 
# what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is 
# up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information 
# and to define several procedures that operate on the network. 
#
# In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the 
# information comes in a big string of text. Each pair of sentences in the text 
# is formatted as follows: 
# 
# <user> is connected to <user1>, ..., <userM>.<user> likes to play <game1>, ..., <gameN>.
#
# For example:
# 
# John is connected to Bryant, Debra, Walter.John likes to play The Movie: The Game, The Legend of Corgi, Dinosaur Diner.
# 
# Note that each sentence will be separated from the next by only a period. There will 
# not be whitespace or new lines between sentences.
# 
# Your friend records the information in that string based on user activity on 
# the website and gives it to you to manage. You can think of every pair of
# sentences as defining a user's profile.
#
# Consider the data structures that we have used in class - lists, dictionaries,
# and combinations of the two (e.g. lists of dictionaries). Pick one that
# will allow you to manage the data above and implement the procedures below. 
# 
# You may assume that <user> is a unique identifier for a user. For example, there
# can be at most one 'John' in the network. Furthermore, connections are not 
# symmetric - if 'Bob' is connected to 'Alice', it does not mean that 'Alice' is
# connected to 'Bob'.
#
# Project Description
# ====================
# Your task is to complete the procedures according to the specifications below
# as well as to implement a Make-Your-Own procedure (MYOP). You are encouraged 
# to define any additional helper procedures that can assist you in accomplishing 
# a task. You are encouraged to test your code by using print statements and the 
# Test Run button. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# Example string input. Use it to test your code.

# create_data_structure(string_input): 
#   Parses a block of text (such as the one above) and stores relevant 
#   information into a data structure. You are free to choose and design any 
#   data structure you would like to use to manage the information.
# 
# Arguments: 
#   string_input: block of text containing the network information
#
#   You may assume that for all the test cases we will use, you will be given the 
#   connections and games liked for all users listed on the right-hand side of an
#   'is connected to' statement. For example, we will not use the string 
#   "A is connected to B.A likes to play X, Y, Z.C is connected to A.C likes to play X."
#   as a test case for create_data_structure because the string does not 
#   list B's connections or liked games.
#   
#   The procedure should be able to handle an empty string (the string '') as input, in
#   which case it should return a network with no users.
# 
# Return:
#   The newly created network data structure

#is connected to
#likes to play

# Arguments:
#   network: The network you created with create_data_structure.

# Sample output:

#   This implies that Abe is connected with Gel, who is connected with Sam, 
#   who is connected with Zed.
# 
# NOTE:
#   You must solve this problem using recursion!
# 
# Hints: 
# - Be careful how you handle connection loops, for example, A is connected to B. 
#   B is connected to C. C is connected to B. Make sure your code terminates in 
#   that case.
# - If you are comfortable with default parameters, you might consider using one 
#   in this procedure to keep track of nodes already visited in your search. You 
#   may safely add default parameters since all calls used in the grading script 
#   will only include the arguments network, user_A, and user_B.
